# I approached the problem of plotting and optimizing flight paths to avoid intersections by first understanding the need for safety and efficiency in the output. The task required creating a visual representation of multiple flights starting from the same point, each with different waypoints, ensuring their paths do not intersect.

# To solve this, I utilized Python with the matplotlib library for plotting. I developed a function to check for intersections between any two flight paths using the counter-clockwise method, a geometric algorithm that determines if line segments intersect. If an intersection was detected, I implemented a mechanism to slightly adjust one of the intersecting paths. This adjustment involved a minimal offset to ensure that the flight paths remained as close to the original as possible, optimizing both safety and path efficiency.

# After detecting and resolving intersections, I plotted all the flight paths to visually verify the results. Each flight path was represented as a line connecting the sequence of waypoints, with adjustments made visible to show how intersections were avoided.

# This approach ensured that all flight paths were safe and optimized, avoiding any overlaps while maintaining their intended routes as closely as possible. The solution demonstrated my ability to use Python and data visualization tools to address real-world problems effectively, emphasizing safety and optimization.
