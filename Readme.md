# Solutions to Fretron Backend Internship Assignments

This repository contains solutions for assignments provided by Fretron as part of their backend internship application process. The solutions are implemented in Python and demonstrate various problem-solving and algorithm design skills.

## Assignment 1: Flight Path Optimization
This solution involves drawing flight paths for multiple flights on a chessboard, ensuring that paths do not intersect for safety and optimization. The implementation uses a visualization method to display how the castle's movement and flight paths are managed on the board.

## Assignment 2: Proportional Apple Distribution
In this problem, a set of apples with varying weights needs to be distributed among individuals based on their proportional contributions. The solution includes a Python program that reads apple weights and proportionally allocates them without splitting any apples, ensuring fair distribution based on the amount paid by each person.

## Assignment 3: Specialized Castle Pathfinding
This task simulates the movement of a specialized castle on a chessboard with randomly placed soldiers. The castle can move forward, kill soldiers, and then move left while avoiding intersections. The solution demonstrates how to compute all possible paths the castle can take to return to its starting position, following the movement rules specified.

Each solution includes sample code, explanations, and output results to illustrate the functionality and correctness of the approach.
